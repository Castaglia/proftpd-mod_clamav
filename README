I've modified the mod_clamav version from:

  http://www.thrallingpenguin.com/resources/mod_clamav.htm

Changes:

1. No patching of the core proftpd code required.
2. Works with SFTP/SCP transfers.
3. Generates event when an infested file is upload; mod_ban can then generate
   a ban based on this event.
